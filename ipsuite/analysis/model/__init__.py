"""As in all ML applications, analysing both the dataset and model predictions
are of paramount importance.
For dataset exploration it is often convenient to visualize the distribution of labels.
Most Nodes are concerned with analysing trained models and
often compare to a reference calculator.
This ranges from simple prediction correlation plots to force decompositions and
energy-volume curves.
