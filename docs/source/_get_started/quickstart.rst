Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

The IPS package can be downloaded via the package-management system pip.
We recommend the usage of an python environment with the python version 3.10. Other versions might not currently work.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ipsuite

Alternatively the latest version of IPSuite can be downloaded from `GitHub <https://github.com/zincware/IPSuite>`_,
using `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ to install the python dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/zincware/IPSuite.git
    cd IPSuite
    poetry install

For IPSuite to work, it is necessary for an IPS Project to be in a git as well as DVC initialized directory.
Create a folder for your project and initialize git and DVC to start working with IPS.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir project
    cd project
    git init
    dvc init

In a file :code:`main.py` try importing IPS to check if everything is working correctly

.. code-block:: python

    import ipsuite as ips



To get to know the IPS procedures we will do an example problem.


The First Project
=================

Initial Data Generation
-----------------------
This project will show the basic creation of an IPS Project using an additional piece of software
called `Packmol <https://m3g.github.io/packmol/>`_.
The goal is to place water molecules inside a box at a specified density.

.. code-block:: python

    import ipsuite as ips

    with ips.Project() as project:
        # Generate a single water molecule
        mol = ips.SmilesToAtoms(smiles="O")
        # Duplicate water molecules
        packmol = ips.Packmol(
            data=[mol.atoms], count=[10], density=876
            )

    project.build()

The *SmilesToAtoms* node takes the `SMILES <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system>`_ string for water ("O"),
and generates an an `ASE atoms object <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/atoms.html>`_ from it.
This atom from the SmilesToAtoms instance can be accessd by calling `mol.atoms`.
This instance attribute is then handed over to the Packmol node in the `data` attribute.
It is possible to hand over multiple different types of ASE atoms,
so `mol.atoms` as to be given as a list. The next attribute we need to set is the amount of molecules we want to place in the box.
This also has to be a list with each entry being the amount for other ASE atoms object in the `data` list. Lastly the density has
to be provided. Calling `project.build()` will save the workflow into DVC graph configuration and parameter files.
After executing the code, the entire workflow is constructed and can be visualised
by running `dvc dag`, which shows the graph of the workflow. Using the option `dvc dag --mermaid` will return a flowchart, which can be
used with `Mermaid <https://mermaid.js.org/>`_ to better visualise the workflows.

The parameters files, namely `params.yaml` can be viewed and parameters can be changed without rerunning the python script.

By calling `dvc repro` the workflow consisting of the nodes is executed, which results in the generation of firstly a single water molecule by the SmilesToAtoms node and then the placement
of multiple water molecules in a box by the Packmol node.
After running `dvc repro` a new folder `nodes` is created which each node having their own subfolder. These folders
contain the results from the Nodes.

Using the closely to IPSuite related software `ZnDraw <https://github.com/zincware/ZnDraw>`_, which can be installed via `pip install zndraw`,
we can visualise the H5MD files generated by the nodes.

.. code-block:: bash

    zndraw nodes/SmilesToAtoms/structures.h5

will visualise the single water molecule generated by SmilesToAtoms. There will also be a H5MD file in the Packmol folder

.. figure:: ../images/water_packmol.png
    :alt: ZnDraw Screenshot

    Screenshot of the ZnDraw visualistion of the Watermoluclas generated by packmol.


Now that the workflow has been created, we can change all parameters in the `params.yaml` at will and run `dvc repro` to
execute the nodes with the new parameters. If `dvc repro` is run again without changing any parameters, no node will be
executed, but the data from the cache will be loaded.
