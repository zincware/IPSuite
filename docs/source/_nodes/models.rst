Models
======

IPS allows for easy use and comparison of different machine learning interatomic potentials.
Below you can find all models currently interfaced with this framework.
A model's run method performs training on the provided data.
All models provide an ASE calculator, which can be used for inference and analysis of predictions.

Note that each model is an extra dependency and needs to be installed accordingly.
See getting started for more information.
If you would like to add other models to IPS, please consider this guide.
